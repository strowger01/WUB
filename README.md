# WUB
"Windows Update Blocker (WUB) is a simple tool to toggle the automatic updates on and off in Windows, providing users with full control over their update preferences."

It works like other progams.

# Working
Just start the program as admin. If not it will break and refuse to do it.


May sometimes it will be broke. Just wait the next upd or edit yourself (not being arrogant).

bye and that is it :3
